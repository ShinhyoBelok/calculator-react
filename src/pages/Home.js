        There is no place for speculation. Whenever 
        you try to prove something in maths, you need 
        evidence. I personally believe that this is 
        something which should be applied in other 
        aspects of life as wellâ€¦ imagine the number 
        of misunderstandings which could be prevented 
        if visual/auditory evidence had to be provided!
      </p>

        So what are you waiting les't do some 
        calculation to prove our answers.
